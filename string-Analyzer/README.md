#### For each analyzed string, compute and store the following properties:
- length: Number of characters in the string
- is_palindrome: Boolean indicating if the string reads the same forwards and backwards (case-insensitive)
- unique_characters: Count of distinct characters in the string
- word_count: Number of words separated by whitespace
- sha256_hash: SHA-256 hash of the string for unique identification
- character_frequency_map: Object/dictionary mapping each character to its occurrence count
